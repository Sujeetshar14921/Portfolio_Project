# Portfolio Project

This is a Vite + React portfolio site with a Liquid Glass theme and animated hero.

What I changed and included:
- Hero section with animated typewriter and avatar
- Theme selector and dark mode toggle
- Reusable Avatar component and Social icons
- Liquid Glass visual styles in `src/index.css`

To run locally:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\sujee\OneDrive\Desktop\codex\portfolio"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview
```

If you want me to exclude or include any specific files before pushing, tell me which files to keep/remove.# SDE Portfolio (Vite + React + Tailwind)

This is a minimal, modern Software Development Engineer portfolio built with React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion and React Router. It includes example components and example data in `src/data.js` so you can quickly customize it for your profile.

Getting started

1. cd into the `portfolio` folder
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run dev server: `npm run dev`

Notes

- Replace the sample data in `src/data.js` with your own projects, skills, and experience.
- Update EmailJS keys in `src/components/ContactForm.jsx` and replace the placeholder IDs.
- Add your avatar images into `public/image/` or `portfolio/image/` as appropriate.
